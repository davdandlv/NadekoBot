# Changelog
This version of Nadeko Bot was created to add some extra features Kwoth might not have implemented yet.

## 2017-06-18
 - Changed filter system. Any message containing a substring that equals a filtered word is deleted. Useful for people who like to get bury filtered words in URLs or bigger words.
 - Added Bash Script to run program easily. Simply place modified credentials.json into src/NadekoBot and run the run.bat script.
